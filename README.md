### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### My name is Leyna.

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Major at UCI! This fall semester I am taking a **Data Structures in C++ course**.

I hope to continually work on projects and build up my GitHub!

You can find me here on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leyna-nguyen-4a60a8232)!
